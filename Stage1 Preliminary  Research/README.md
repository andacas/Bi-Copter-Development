# Stage 1: Preliminary Research and Conceptualization
Work to do:
- [x] Define Objectives
- [ ] Literature Review
- [ ] Conceptual Design

## Define Objectives

 1. **Payload of 3-4kg**
 this means that the drone  design should weight around 3kg, this is because this project is one operation mode of a mobile robot.
 
 2. **Teleoperate with ROS2**
 This project will handle the comunications using ros, for the sensors and also for the fly controller.
 
 3. **Been able to stay on a single position**
 Use sensors to estimate the position control, investigate what is the most reliable way.
 
 4. **Trayectory tracking**
 The idea is to be able to create waypoints for the robot to follow.
