# Bicopter_Altitude

In this project, we simulated model of Bicopter in both 2D and 3D systems, and applied PID Controller (Tuned using Lyapunov's Stability Analysis), and Fuzzy Logic Controller, and plotted it's pitch, yaw and altitude.

## Requirement

This project was made on MATLAB version R2022b, so it can be executed on versions greater than it. Not sure about the versions below R2022b

Before running the .slx file, load all the Fuzzy Logic Controller's parameters by executing `load_fuzzy_parameters.m`
